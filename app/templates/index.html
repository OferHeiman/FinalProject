    <p style="text-align: center;word-wrap: break-word;">
        The quick response, or QR, Code is a two-dimensional version of the Barcode able to convey a wide<br>
        variety of information almost instantly with the scan of a mobile device.<br>
        <br>
        Able to store up to 7089 digits or 4296 characters, including punctuation marks and special<br>
        characters, the Code can equally encode words and phrases such as internet addresses. One thing to<br>
        always keep in mind, especially when it comes to designing the Static QR Codes aesthetic is that the<br>
        more data is added, the more the size increases and its structure becomes more complex.<br>
        <br>
        Even when damaged, the QR Codeâ€™s structure data keys include duplications. It is thanks to these<br>
        redundancies that allow up to 30% of the Code structure to take damage without affecting its<br>
        readability on scanners.
